# Car Recommendation Engine (Reinforcement Learning + PPO)

This project implements a car recommendation system using Reinforcement Learning (PPO).  
The model learns to match customers to the best cars in a CSV dataset based on:

- Budget  
- Power preference  
- Body type  
- Fuel type  
- Family size  
- Preference strictness (must / strong / soft)

It includes a refinement layer for accurate ranking and an explanation engine for human-readable output.
